I have yet to use CSS to recreate a website from scratch. Most of my usage of CSS and HTML have been recreating small bits of test code either in lessons such as the web developer Udemy course or the FreeCodeCamp.

This will be a good exercise to finally structure all of the CSS and HTML into a readable website.
